To develop this package from source:

- check out the software from the repository

- ``cd`` to the checkout

- Ideally with a clean, non-system python, run
  ``python bootstrap/bootstrap.py``

- run ``./bin/buildout``

To run tests, run *both* of the following:

- ``./bin/test``: this tests zc.async without any zope.app stuff

- ``./bin/z3test``: this tests zc.async with zc.z3monitor code, along with a
  lot of zope.app that it drags along.

Changes should be documented in CHANGES.txt *in the package*.

Before making a release that registers the software to PyPI, run the following:

- ``./bin/py setup.py``

This then creates a file with the following silly name:
``TEST_THIS_REST_BEFORE_REGISTERING.txt``

As the name suggests, test the file in a ReST tool to make sure docutils
parses it correctly.

Once this works, go ahead and ``./bin/py setup.py sdist register upload``.

BUILDING SPHINX DOCS

sphinx-build -b <builder> sphinx sphinx/.build

Then tar the resulting files in the sphinx/.build directory and upload to PyPI.
