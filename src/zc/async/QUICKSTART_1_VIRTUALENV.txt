What?
=====

- Reliable, easy-to-use, Python tool

- Schedules work across processes and machines

.. class:: handout

    zc.async is an easy-to-use Python tool that schedules work across
    multiple processes and machines.

For instance...
===============

...for web apps
===============

Maybe your web application lets users request the creation of a large PDF, or
some other expensive task.

...for postponed work
=====================

Maybe you have a job that needs to be done at a certain time, not right now.

.. class:: handout

    Work is always, minimally, postponed till after your current transaction
    commits.

    Work can also be scheduled to begin after a certain datetime.  This will
    be honored as closely as the poll interval and other tasks running at the
    desired start time allow.

    zc.async does not inherently support recurring tasks, but such patterns can
    be implemented easily on top of zc.async.  One simple pattern is to have
    a callback schedule a new task at the next desired time.

...for parallel processing
==========================

Maybe you have a long-running problem that can be made to complete faster by
splitting it up into discrete parts, each performed in parallel, across
multiple machines.

.. class:: handout

    As shown later, the easiest way to accomplish this is to use
    ``zc.async.job.parallel``. Given three decomposed tasks, ``job_A``,
    ``job_B``, and ``job_C``; a postprocess task named ``postprocess``; and an
    instance of a zc.async queue, this line would schedule a composite parallel
    job::

        >>  queue.put(
        ...     zc.async.job.parallel(
        ...         job_A, job_B, job_C, postprocess=postprocess))

.. We use ">>" intentionally when we don't want to run these lines as a test.

...for serial processing
========================

Maybe you want to decompose and serialize a job.

.. class:: handout

    As shown later, the easiest way to accomplish this is to use
    ``zc.async.job.serial``.  Given three decomposed tasks, ``job_A``, ``job_B``,
    and ``job_C``; a postprocess task named ``postprocess``; and an instance
    of a zc.async queue, this line would schedule a composite serial job::

        >> queue.put(
        ...     zc.async.job.serial(
        ...         job_A, job_B, job_C, postprocess=postprocess))

High-level Features
===================

- easy to use

- flexible configuration

- reliable

- supports high availability

- good debugging tools

- well-tested

- friendly to testing

.. class:: handout

    zc.async helps you perform those jobs easily, but with a lot of available
    configuration if you need it. It lets you perform these jobs reliably, with
    high availability and control over how to handle errors and system
    interruptions. It gives you good tools to analyze and debug problems in
    your asynchronous jobs. It is well-tested and has test helpers for you to
    use and test patterns for you to follow.

An Experiment
=============

To start, install |virtualenv|_ and create a virtual environment for our
experiments.

.. class:: handout

    I prefer zc.buildout for production deployments, but virtualenv is very
    nice for quick experimentation.

Install zc.async in the virtual environment.

::

    $ easy_install virtualenv
    $ virtualenv quickstart
    $ cd quickstart/
    $ ./bin/easy_install zc.async

.. |virtualenv| replace:: ``virtualenv``

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

Dependencies
============

This installed the ZODB, Twisted, the basic Zope component architecture, and a
few smaller packages.

ZEO Server
==========

zc.async relies on a distributed ZODB technology called ZEO ("Zope Enterprise
Objects") to distribute work. ZEO has a central database server to which client
processes connect.

Let's start the ZEO Server::

    ./bin/runzeo -a 9999 -f test.fs &

That starts a database server, accessible on port 9999 of your local machine,
saving the data in the test.fs file.

A Client
========

Now let's start a Python with a client connection to the database server.

Start up ``bin/python`` (not your system python, but the one in virtualenv's
``quickstart/bin``)::

    $ ./bin/python

This will be our single client process.  You might have many.

Database Connection
===================

Connect to the database.

::

    >>  import ZEO.ClientStorage
    >>  import ZODB
    >>  storage = ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage(
    ...     ('127.0.0.1', 9999))
    >>  db = ZODB.DB(storage)

.. When run as a doctest, this uses a simple FileStorage, rather than a
   ClientStorage.

    >>> import ZODB.FileStorage
    >>> storage = ZODB.FileStorage.FileStorage(
    ...     'zc_async.fs', create=True)
    >>> from ZODB.DB import DB
    >>> db = DB(storage)

Start zc.async: Basics
======================

Now we do some basic configuration.  This first bit installs some default
adapters.  You might not ever have to worry too much about them.

    >>> import zc.async.configure
    >>> zc.async.configure.base()

Start zc.async: Policy
======================

This second part is policy, and if you ever put zc.async in production, you'll
want to understand what's going on here.  We'll talk about what's going on here
a little later.

    >>> zc.async.configure.start(
    ...     db, poll_interval=1)

Now the system is polling for jobs every second.

The Queue
=========

The ``start`` function also installed a queue.  To get zc.async to do work, you
put a job in a queue, and commit the transaction.

First, let's get the queue that we have installed.  We need to open a
connection to the database.  Then we get the queue.

    >>> conn = db.open()
    >>> import zc.async.interfaces
    >>> q = zc.async.interfaces.IQueue(conn)

A Job
=====

Let's put a job in our queue.

.. class:: handout

    This is a silly example. Imagine instead that this was some really
    long-running job. Maybe you have lots of these jobs coming in, and you need
    to have many machines to claim jobs and perform them, so that you can
    scale. Maybe this job divides itself up into parallel or serial jobs, and
    this parent job isn't done until all the children jobs run to completion.

    Or maybe this is a silly example.

..

    >>> import time
    >>> j = q.put(time.time)
    >>> j.result
    >>> j.status
    u'pending-status'

We have to commit the transaction for the dispatcher to see the job.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

A Result
========

Now wait a second and then try this.  "transaction.begin" will sync up our
database with database changes made elsewhere.

.. This lets us "wait a second".

    >>> import zc.async.testing
    >>> res = zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(j)

..

    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> j.result
    1216179006.856108
    >>> j.status
    u'completed-status'

Another Job
===========

You can also make closures by passing in the job class explicitly.  Generating
RSA keys is actually a reasonable real-world use case for something like this.

::

    >>  import subprocess
    >>  j = q.put(zc.async.job.Job(
    ...     subprocess.call,
    ...     ['openssl', 'genrsa', '-out',
    ...      'key.pem', '1024']))
    >>  transaction.commit()

Another Result
==============

    >>  j.result
    >>  _ = transaction.begin()
    >>  j.result
    0
    >>  subprocess.call(['cat', 'key.pem'])
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    MIICXgIBAAKBgQCYAZW+HjDGJhRHnUlZZWqhrGOxU2K/RhssmcMs0JLnWI2cWmZ+
    ...
    CEcz6ZbO8zm4AEGI/dqLicZh3bhunhflAovW6WxbNKLENQ==
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    0

XXX
===

Next need to discuss that callables must be picklable, so we need to switch
from the interpreter to the filesystem.

Talk about callbacks, and how that lets you respond to results.

Talk briefly about failures, show the exceptions, and briefly mention logging
and debugging.

Start up multiple processes with dispatchers.

Close by referring to production instances needing something like zdaemon
or supervisor; and to preferring the more declarative zc.buildout style for
production...which we'll show in our next quickstart! ;-)

.. Now we are going to stop the reactor.

    >>> import zc.async.dispatcher
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
    >>> reactor = dispatcher.reactor
    >>> reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop)
    >>> dispatcher.thread.join(3)
