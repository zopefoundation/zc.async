Quickstart with Grok_

Goals

In this quickstart, we will use zc.async to make a small web application that
XXX

XXX For simplicity, we'll assume that we are making several instances on the
same machine, such as you might do with a few processors at your disposal.  To
get the true advantage of high availability in production, you'd want at least
two boxes, with a deployment of a ZEO server (or equivalent, for RelStorage),
some kind of redundancy for your database (ZRS, slony) and instructions for
each box on how to connect to the ZEO primary.

This quickstart builds on the :ref:`quickstart-with-virtualenv`.  I suggest you
read that through before this one.  

- That previous quickstart introduces |async| through the Python interpreter
  for a very casual and quick start.  

- It also is more "pure-Python" with very little understanding needed of
  additional frameworks to follow and use the examples.

This quickstart instead uses the following somewhat "heavier" technologies.

- |zc.buildout|_ is a way of producing repeatable software build-outs, for
  development and conceivably for deployment.  It is written in Python, but is
  not Python-specific, and it has found use as a ``make`` replacement for many
  projects.

- Grok_ is a web framework emerging from "Zope 3" technologies.  From their
  website:
  
    Grok is a web application framework for Python developers. It is aimed at
    both beginners and very experienced web developers. Grok has an emphasis on
    agile development. Grok is easy and powerful.

This guide, then, takes a somewhat slower definition of "quick" for its
"quickstart", in exchange for more guidance and care with a view towards
production-readiness.

Prerequisites
=============

.. sidebar:: Building Python 2.4.5 on OS X Leopard

   Unfortunately, building a clean, standalone workable Python 2.4.5 on OS X is
   not obvious.  This is what I recommend, if you are working on that platform.
   
   First you need macports.  Go to macports.org and download the newest
   version.  It doesn't seem to set up the manual path correctly, so after the
   installation add this to your ~/.profile (or in a similar place)::
   
    export MANPATH=/opt/local/man:$MANPATH
   
   You'll need a new terminal session (or other shell magic if you know it) for
   these changes to take effect.  The easiest thing to do is close the shell
   you are working in and open a new one.

   Download a source distribution of Python 2.4.5.  You may have your own
   approach as to where to put things, but I'll go with this pattern in this
   document: ~/src will hold expanded source trees, ~/opt will hold our local
   Python, and we'll develop in ~/dev.
   
   We will want readline and need zlib from macports.

   ::

    $ sudo port -c install readline
    $ sudo port -c install zlib
   
   Now we'll do the usual dance, with a couple of ugly extra steps.

   **Note: replace ``/Users/gary/opt/py`` in the below with your own desired
   location!**

   ::

    $ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 ./configure \
      --prefix=/Users/gary/opt/py \
      LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib \
      OPT=-I/opt/local/include
    $ make
    $ make install

   Now, given my ``--prefix``, I'll find my python in
   ``/Users/gary/opt/py/bin/python``.

Grok requires Python 2.4.  Moreover, for more repeatable installations, many
developers strongly recommend using a "clean", non-system Python, to reduce the
probability of unnecessary or spurious problems (in your software *or* in your
system!).  Therefore, consider building your own Python 2.4 for your
development.

We'll also expect that your Python has |easy_install|_.  If it doesn't, you can
just download `ez_setup.py`_ and then run it with your local, development
Python (e.g., ``~/opt/py/bin/python ez_setup.py``). This will install the
easy_install command for your development Python in the same bin directory as
your Python (e.g., ``~/opt/py/bin/easy_install``).

.. sidebar:: |zc.buildout| Conveniences

   You may want to consider the following conveniences if you are building many
   projects with |zc.buildout|.  They make zc.buildout keep two shared
   collections across all of your zc.buildout projects.  This can significantly
   speed up the time to buildout new applications.  One shared collection is a
   download cache of source distributions and eggs.  The other is an egg cache
   only, for both the downloaded eggs and the eggs generated on your machine.
   
   In your home directory, make a ``.buildout`` directory.  In that directory,
   make two sub-directories, ``eggs`` and ``download-cache``.  Also in
   ``.buildout``, create a file named ``default.cfg`` with the following
   content, where ``/Users/gary`` is replaced with the path to your home
   directory::

    [buildout]
    eggs-directory=/Users/gary/.buildout/eggs
    download-cache=/Users/gary/.buildout/download-cache

   There are many other possible settings to make here (for instance, we could
   specify the clean Python you built here), but these are all I
   currently bother with.

   It is also worth mentioning that, as of this writing, setuptools builds eggs
   in such a way as to confuse the Python debugger.  If you use the Python
   debugger and discover that you want to see the lines in an egg and can't,
   the following line (or something like it) will help for non-zipped eggs::
   
    find ~/.buildout/eggs-aside/ -name '*.pyc' -exec rm {} \;

Grok has a pleasantly convenient way to start a project.  It is called
grokproject_.  Use your local Python's ``easy_install`` to install it.  For
instance, I might type ``~/opt/py/bin/easy_install grokproject``.

After it runs, it should have installed the ``grokproject`` command in the same
bin directory as your local Python (e.g., ``~/opt/py/bin/grokproject``).

Skeleton
========

Now we will use grokproject_ to make a skeleton of our package.  Let's just
call the project "quickstart".  Go to a directory in which you want to develop
our package.  Then use the newly installed ``grokproject`` command to create

XXX

- include zc.async in setup.py; mention versions.cfg

- set up ZEO

- set up multiple instances

- zope.app.testing = 3.4.1 -> 3.4.2

- set up interpreter

- set up z3monitor

- make separate debug instance
