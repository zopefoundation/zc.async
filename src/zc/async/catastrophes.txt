Recovering from Catastrophes
============================

--------------------
What Might Go Wrong?
--------------------

Sometimes bad things happen in the course of processing tasks. What might go
wrong? How does zc.async handle these errors? What are your responsibilities?

First, what might go wrong?

- zc.async could have a problem while polling for jobs.  We'll call this a
  "polling exception."

- zc.async could have a problem while performing a particular job.  We'll call
  this a "job-related exception."

For the purpose of this discussion, we will omit the possibility that zc.async
has a bug. That is certainly a possibility, but the recovery story is not
predictable, and if we knew of a bug, we'd try to fix it, rather than discuss
it here!

We'll discuss both polling exceptions and job related exceptions, then drill
down into some specific scenarios. This will illuminate how your code and
zc.async's can work together to handle them.

Polling Exceptions
------------------

Polling exceptions are, at least in theory, the least of your worries. You
shouldn't have to worry about them; and if you do, it is probably a basic
configuration problem that you need to address, such as making sure that the
dispatcher process has access to the needed databases and software; or making
sure that the dispatcher process is run by a daemonizing software that will
restart if needed, such as zdaemon (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zdaemon) or
supervisor (http://supervisord.org/).

zc.async is largely responsible for dealing with polling exceptions. What does
it have to handle?

- The process running the poll ends, perhaps in the middle of a poll.

- zc.async cannot commit a transaction during the poll, for instance because of
  a ConflictError, or because the database is unavailable.

What needs to happen to handle these problems?

Process Ends while Polling
..........................

If the process ends, your daemonizing front-end (zdaemon, supervisor, etc.)
needs to restart it. The ZODB will discard incomplete transaction data, if any.

The only thing a zc.async dispatcher needs to handle is clean up.

- Ideally it will be able to deactivate its record in the ZODB during the
  process shutdown.

- Instead, if it was a "hard crash" that didn't allow deactivation, a sibling
  dispatcher will realize that the dispatcher is down and deactivate it.

- Or, finally, if it was a hard crash without a sibling, and the daemon
  restarts a process for the original dispatcher instance, the new process
  needs to realize that the old process is dead, not competing with it.

Transaction Error while Polling
...............................

If the poll gets a conflict error, it should simply abort and retry the poll,
forever, with a small back-off.

If the database goes away (perhaps the ZEO server goes down for a bit, and the
ZEO client to which the dispatcher is connected is trying to reconnect) it
should gracefully try to wait for the database to return, and resume when it
does.

Other, more dramatic errors, such as POSKey errors, are generally considered to
be out of zc.async's domain and control. It should ideally continue to try to
resume as long as the process is alive, in case somehow the situation improves,
but this may be difficult and the expectations for zc.async's recovery are
lower than with ConflictErrors and ClientDisconnected errors.

Summary of Polling Exceptions
.............................

To repeat, then, polling exceptions have two basic scenarios.

If a dispatcher process ends, it needs to deactivate its record in the ZODB, or
let another process know to deactivate it.

If a ZODB.POSException.ConflictError occurs, retry forever with a small
backoff; or if ZEO.Exceptions.ClientDisconnected occurs, retry forever with a
small backoff, waiting for the database to come back.

Most anything else will ideally keep zc.async attempting to re-poll, but it may
not happen: expectations are lower.

Job-Related Exceptions
----------------------

What about job-related exceptions? Responsibility for handling job-related
exceptions is shared between your code and zc.async's.  What might happen?

- Your job might fail internally.

- The process running your task ends before completing your task.

- zc.async cannot commit a transaction after your task completes, for instance
  because of a ConflictError, or because the database is unavailable.

What should occur to handle these problems?

Job Fails
.........

As discussed elsewhere, if your job fails in your own code, this is mostly
your responsibility. You should handle possible errors both within your job's
code, and in callbacks, as appropriate.

The other tool at your disposal for this situation, as with others below, is a
retry policy. Retry policies let you determine what zc.async should do when
your job fails. The default retry policy for job failures (as well as commit
failures, below) is that transaction errors, such as conflict errors, are
retried five times, and a ZEO ClientDisconnected error is retried forever with
a backoff. You can customize these.

Other than supporting these tools, zc.async's only other responsibilities are
to report.

By default, zc.async will log a failure of a job entered in a queue at the
"ERROR" level in the ``zc.async.events`` log, and it will log a failure of a
callback or other internal job at the "CRITICAL" level. This can be controlled
per-process and per-job, as we'll see below. These tracebacks include
information about the local and global variables for each frame in the stack,
which can be useful to deduce the problem that occurred.

zc.async also includes a ``Failure`` object on the job as a result, to let you
react to the problem in a callback, and analyze it later.  This is discussed in
detail in other documents.

Process Ends During Job
.......................

If a process ends while it is performing a job, that is similar, in large part,
to the possibility of the process ending the polling job: we need to restart
the process, and realize that we had started the job. But should we restart the
job, or abort it?

Answering this question is a matter of policy, and requires knowing what each
job does.

Generally, if a job is fully transactional, such as writing something to the
ZODB, and the job has not timed out yet, you'll want to restart it. You might
want to restart some reasonably large number of times, and then suspect that,
since you can't seem to finish the job, maybe the job is causing the process to
die, and you should abort.  Or perhaps you want to restart for ever.

If the job isn't transactional, such as communicating with an external service,
you might want to abort the job, and set up some callbacks to handle the
fallout.

As we'll see below, zc.async defaults to guessing that jobs placed directly in
a queue are transactional, and can be tried up to ten times; and that jobs
used as callbacks are also transactional, and can be tried until they
succeed.  The defaults can be changed and the behavior of an individual
job can be changed.

These settings are controlled with a RetryPolicy, discussed below.

Transaction Error During Job
............................

Handling transaction errors after processing a job is also similar to the
handling of transaction errors for polling exceptions. ConflictErrors and
ClientDisconnected errors should often cause jobs to be aborted and restarted.
However, if the job is not transactional, such as communicating with an
external service, a simple abort and retry may be hazardous. Also, many jobs
should be stopped if they retry on ConflictError more than some number of
times--a heuristic bellweather--with the logic that they may be simply doing
something too problematic, and they are blocking other tasks from starting. But
other jobs should be retried until they complete.

As mentioned above, zc.async defaults to guessing that jobs are transactional.
Client Disconnected errors are retried forever, with a small backoff. Jobs
placed in a queue retry transaction errors, such as ConflictErrors, four times,
while callbacks retry them forever. The defaults can be changed and the
behavior of an individual job can be changed, using the RetryPolicy described
below.

Summary of Job-Related Exceptions
.................................

If an exception occurs in your job's code, zc.async will log it as an ERROR
if a main queue job and as CRITICAL if it is a callback; and it will make the
result of the call a ``Failure`` with error information, as shown elsewhere.
Everything else is your responsibility, to be handled with try:except or
try:finally blocks in your code, callbacks, or custom RetryPolicies.

Process death, conflict errors, and ``ClientDisconnected`` errors all may need
to be handled differently for different jobs. zc.async has a default policy for
jobs placed in a queue, and for callback jobs. The default policy, a
RetryPolicy, can be changed and can be set explicitly per-job.

Your Responsibilities
---------------------

As the author of a zc.async job, your responsibilities, then, are to handle
your own exceptions; and to make sure that the retry policy for each job is
appropriate.  This is controlled with an IRetryPolicy, as shown below.

As someone configuring a running dispatcher, you need to make sure that you
give the dispatcher the necessary access to databases and software to perform
your jobs, and you need to review (and rotate!) your logs.

zc.async's Responsibilities
---------------------------

zc.async needs to have polling robust in the face of restarts, ConflictErrors
and ClientDisconnected errors. It needs to give your code a chance to decide
what to do in these circumstances, and log your errors.

Retry Policies
--------------

The rest of the document uses scenarios to illustrate how zc.async handles
errors, and how you might want to configure retry policies.

What is a retry policy?  It is used in three circumstances.

- When the job starts but fails to complete because the system is interrupted,
  the job will try to call ``retry_policy.interrupted()`` to get a boolean as
  to whether the job should be retried.

- When the code the job ran fails, the job will try to call
  ``retry_policy.jobError(failure, data_cache)`` to get a boolean as to whether
  the job should be retried.

- When the commit fails, the job will try to call
  ``retry_policy.commitError(failure, data_cache)`` to get a boolean as to
  whether the job should be retried.

Why does this need to be a policy?  Can't it be a simpler arrangement?

The heart of the problem is that different jobs need different error
resolutions.

In some cases, jobs may not be fully transactional.  For instance, the job
may be communicating with an external system, such as a credit card system.
The retry policy here should typically be "never": perhaps a callback should be
in charge of determining what to do next.

If a job is fully transactional, it can be retried.  But even then the desired
behavior may differ.

- In typical cases, some errors should simply cause a failure, while other
  errors, such as database conflict errors, should cause a limited number of
  retries.

- In some jobs, conflict errors should be retried forever, because the job must
  be run to completion or else the system should fall over. Callbacks that try
  to handle errors themselves may take this approach, for instance.

zc.async currently ships with three retry policies.

1.  The default, appropriate for most fully transactional jobs, is the
    zc.async.job.RetryCommonFourTimes.  This retries ZEO disconnects forever;
    and interrupts and transaction errors such as conflicts a set number of
    times.

2.  The other available (pre-written) option for transactional jobs is
    zc.async.job.RetryCommonForever. Callbacks will get this policy by
    default.  This retries ZEO disconnects, transaction errors such as conflict
    errors, interrupts, and *anything* that happens during the job's commit,
    forever.

3.  The last retry policy is zc.async.job.NeverRetry.  This is appropriate for
    non-transactional jobs. You'll still typically need to handle errors in
    your callbacks.

If you look at these, you will see that it is trivial to write your own, if
desired.

Scenarios
---------

We'll examine polling error scenarios and job error scenarios.

- Polling errors

  * The system is polling and gets a ConflictError.

  * The system is polling and gets a ClientDisconnected error.

- Job errors

  * A worker process is working on a job with the default retry policy. The
    process dies gracefully and restarts.

  * Like the previous scenario, a worker process is working on a job with the
    default retry policy. The process crashes hard (does not die gracefully)
    and restarts.

  * Like the previous scenario, a worker process is working on a job with the
    default retry policy. The process crashes hard (does not die gracefully)
    and a sibling notices and takes over.

  * A worker process is working on a job with the default retry policy and gets
    an error during the job or the commit.

-------------------------
Scenarios: Polling Errors
-------------------------

ConflictError
-------------

A common place for a conflict error is with two dispatchers trying to claim the
same job from the queue.  This example will mimic that situation.

Imagine we have a full set up with a dispatcher, agent, and queue. [#setUp]_
We'll actually replace the agent's chooser with one that behaves badly: it
blocks, waiting for our lock.

    >>> import threading
    >>> lock1 = threading.Lock()
    >>> lock2 = threading.Lock()
    >>> lock1.acquire()
    True
    >>> lock2.acquire()
    True
    >>> def acquireLockAndChooseFirst(agent):
    ...     res = agent.queue.claim()
    ...     if res is not None:
    ...         lock2.release()
    ...         lock1.acquire()
    ...     return res
    ...
    >>> import zc.async.instanceuuid
    >>> import zc.async.interfaces
    >>> import zc.async.testing
    >>> import zc.async.dispatcher
    >>> import pprint
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
    >>> pprint.pprint(zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher, 0))
    {'': {'main': {'active jobs': [],
                   'error': None,
                   'len': 0,
                   'new jobs': [],
                   'size': 3}}}
    >>> import transaction
    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> queues = root[zc.async.interfaces.KEY]
    >>> queue = queues['']
    >>> da = queue.dispatchers[zc.async.instanceuuid.UUID]
    >>> agent = da['main']
    >>> agent.chooser = acquireLockAndChooseFirst
    >>> def returnSomething():
    ...     return 42
    ...
    >>> job = queue.put(returnSomething)
    >>> transaction.commit()

Now, when the agent tries to get our job, we'll start and commit another
transaction that removes it from the queue.  This will generate a conflict
error for the poll's thread and transaction, because it cannot also remove the
same job.

    >>> lock2.acquire()
    True
    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> job is queue.pull()
    True
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> lock1.release()

However, the ConflictError is handled, and polling continues.

    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> import zc.async.agent
    >>> agent.chooser = zc.async.agent.chooseFirst
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> import zc.async.dispatcher
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
    >>> import zc.async.testing
    >>> pprint.pprint(zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher))
    {'': {'main': {'active jobs': [],
                   'error': None,
                   'len': 0,
                   'new jobs': [],
                   'size': 3}}}

And if we put the job back, it will be performed.

    >>> job is queue.put(job)
    True
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(job)
    42

Client Disconnected
-------------------

The story is very similar if the ZEO connection goes away for a while.  We'll
mimic a ZEO ClientDisconnected error by monkeypatching
transaction.TranasctionManager.commit.

    >>> lock1.locked()
    True
    >>> lock2.locked()
    True

    >>> agent.chooser = acquireLockAndChooseFirst
    >>> job = queue.put(returnSomething)
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> lock2.acquire()
    True
    >>> import ZEO.Exceptions
    >>> def commit(self):
    ...     raise ZEO.Exceptions.ClientDisconnected()
    ...
    >>> import transaction
    >>> old_commit = transaction.TransactionManager.commit
    >>> transaction.TransactionManager.commit = commit
    >>> import time
    >>> sleep_requests = []
    >>> def sleep(i):
    ...     sleep_requests.append(i)
    ...
    >>> old_sleep = time.sleep
    >>> time.sleep = sleep
    >>> agent.chooser = zc.async.agent.chooseFirst
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> lock1.release()
    >>> pprint.pprint(zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher)) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    {'': {'main': {'active jobs': [],
                   'error': None,
                   'len': 0,
                   'new jobs': [(..., 'unnamed')],
                   'size': 3}}}
    >>> transaction.TransactionManager.commit = old_commit
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(job)
    42
    >>> bool(sleep_requests)
    True

Here's another variant that mimics being unable to read the storage during a
poll, and then recuperating.

    >>> error_raised = False
    >>> def raiseDisconnectedThenChooseFirst(agent):
    ...     global error_raised
    ...     if not error_raised:
    ...         error_raised = True
    ...         raise ZEO.Exceptions.ClientDisconnected()
    ...     return agent.queue.claim()
    >>> agent.chooser = raiseDisconnectedThenChooseFirst
    >>> def returnSomething():
    ...     return 42
    ...
    >>> job = queue.put(returnSomething)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> pprint.pprint(zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher)) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    {'': {'main': {'active jobs': [],
                   'error': <zc.twist.Failure ...ClientDisconnected>,
                   'len': 0,
                   'new jobs': [],
                   'size': 3}}}
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(job)
    42

-----------------------------
Scenarios: Job-Related Errors
-----------------------------

Graceful Shutdown During Job
----------------------------

First let's consider how a failed job with a callback or two is handled when
the dispatcher dies.

Here we start a job.

    >>> import zope.component
    >>> import transaction
    >>> import zc.async.interfaces
    >>> import zc.async.testing
    >>> import zc.async.dispatcher

    >>> queue = root[zc.async.interfaces.KEY]['']
    >>> lock = threading.Lock()
    >>> lock.acquire()
    True
    >>> fail_flag = True
    >>> def wait_for_me():
    ...     global fail_flag
    ...     if fail_flag:
    ...         fail_flag = False
    ...         lock.acquire()
    ...         lock.release() # so we can use the same lock again later
    ...         raise SystemExit() # this will cause the worker thread to exit
    ...     else:
    ...         return 42
    ...
    >>> def handle_result(result):
    ...     return 'I got result %r' % (result,)
    ...
    >>> job = queue.put(wait_for_me)
    >>> callback_job = job.addCallback(handle_result)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
    >>> poll = zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher)
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_start(job)

In this scenario, ``wait_for_me`` is a job that, the first time it is run, will
"unexpectedly" be lost while the dispatcher stops working. ``handle_result``
will simply show us that callbacks will be called successfully.

The job has started. Now, the dispatcher suddenly dies without the thread
performing ``wait_for_me`` getting a chance to finish. For our first example,
let's give the dispatcher a graceful exit. The dispatcher gets a chance to
clean up its dispatcher agents, and job.handleInterrupt() goes into the queue.

    >>> dispatcher.reactor.callFromThread(dispatcher.reactor.stop)
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_deactivation(dispatcher)
    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> job.status == zc.async.interfaces.ACTIVE
    True
    >>> len(queue)
    1
    >>> interrupt_job = queue[0]
    >>> interrupt_job # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <zc.async.job.Job ... ``zc.async.job.Job ... :handleInterrupt()``>
    >>> queue[0].callable # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <bound method Job.handleInterrupt of <...Job ... ``...wait_for_me()``>>

Now when the process starts back up again, ``handleInterrupt`` checks with the
default retry policy as to what should be done. It requests that the job be
retried. It's put back in the queue, and it is called again normally.

    >>> old_dispatcher = dispatcher
    >>> zc.async.dispatcher.clear()
    >>> zc.async.subscribers.ThreadedDispatcherInstaller(
    ...         poll_interval=0.5)(zc.async.interfaces.DatabaseOpened(db))
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(interrupt_job)

Now we need to wait for the job.

    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(job)
    42
    >>> callback_job.status == zc.async.interfaces.COMPLETED
    True
    >>> callback_job.result
    'I got result 42'

The job now has a retry policy with some currently non-interface values that
are still worth showing here.

    >>> policy = job.getRetryPolicy()
    >>> policy.data.get('interruptions')
    1

This shows that the policy registered one interruption. [#cleanup1]_

Hard Crash During Job
---------------------

Our next catastrophe only changes one aspect to the previous one: the
dispatcher does not stop gracefully, and does not have a chance to clean up its
active jobs.  It is a "hard" crash.

To show this, we will start a job, simulate the dispatcher dying "hard," and
restart it so it clean up.

So, first we start a long-running job in the dispatcher.

    >>> lock.acquire()
    True
    >>> fail_flag = True
    >>> job = queue.put(wait_for_me)
    >>> callback_job = job.addCallback(handle_result)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
    >>> poll = zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher)
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_start(job)

Now we'll "crash" the dispatcher.

    >>> dispatcher.activated = False # this will make polling stop, without
    ...                              # cleanup
    >>> dispatcher.reactor.callFromThread(dispatcher.reactor.crash)
    >>> dispatcher.thread.join(3)

Hard crashes can be detected because the dispatchers write datetimes to the
database every few polls. A given dispatcher instance does this for each queue
on a ``DispatcherAgents`` object available in ``queue.dispatchers[UUID]``,
where ``UUID`` is the uuid of that dispatcher.

The ``DispatcherAgents`` object has four pertinent attributes:
``ping_interval``, ``ping_death_interval``, ``last_ping.value``, and ``dead``.
About every ``ping_interval`` (a ``datetime.timedelta``), the dispatcher is
supposed to write a ``datetime`` to ``last_ping.value``. If the
``last_ping.value`` plus the ``ping_death_interval`` (also a ``timedelta``) is
older than now, the dispatcher is considered to be ``dead``, and old jobs
should be cleaned up.

The ``ping_interval`` defaults to 30 seconds, and the ``ping_death_interval``
defaults to 60 seconds. Generally, the ``ping_death_interval`` should be at
least two or three poll intervals (``zc.async.dispatcher.get().poll_interval``)
greater than the ``ping_interval``.

The ping hasn't timed out yet, so the dispatcher isn't considered dead yet.

    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> import zc.async.instanceuuid
    >>> da = queue.dispatchers[zc.async.instanceuuid.UUID]
    >>> da.ping_death_interval
    datetime.timedelta(0, 60)
    >>> da.ping_interval
    datetime.timedelta(0, 30)
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True
    >>> da.dead
    False

Therefore, the job is still sitting around in the dispatcher's pile in the
database (the ``main`` key is for the ``main`` agent installed in this
dispatcher in the set up for these examples).

    >>> job in da['main']
    True
    >>> job.status == zc.async.interfaces.ACTIVE
    True

Let's start our dispatcher up again.

    >>> old_dispatcher = dispatcher
    >>> zc.async.dispatcher.clear()
    >>> zc.async.subscribers.ThreadedDispatcherInstaller(
    ...         poll_interval=0.5)(zc.async.interfaces.DatabaseOpened(db))
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()

Initially, it's going to be a bit confused, because it sees that the
DispatcherAgents object is ``activated``, and not ``dead``. It can't tell if
there's another process using its same UUID, or if it is looking at the result
of a hard crash.

    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(job, seconds=1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: job never completed
    >>> zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher, seconds=1)
    {'': None}
    >>> for r in reversed(event_logs.records):
    ...     if r.levelname == 'ERROR':
    ...         break
    ... else:
    ...     assert False, 'did not find log'
    ...
    >>> print r.getMessage() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    UUID ... already activated in queue  (oid 4): another process?
    (To stop poll attempts in this process, set
    ``zc.async.dispatcher.get().activated = False``.  To stop polls
    permanently, don't start a zc.async.dispatcher!)

To speed up the realization of our dispatcher that the previous activation is
``dead``, we'll set the ping_death_interval to just one second.

    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> da.dead
    False
    >>> job in da['main']
    True
    >>> len(queue)
    0
    >>> import datetime
    >>> da.ping_death_interval = datetime.timedelta(seconds=1)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_death(da)
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True

After the next poll, the dispatcher will have cleaned up its old tasks in the
same way we saw in the previous example. The job's ``handleInterrupt`` method
will be called, and the job will be put back in the queue to be retried. The
DispatcherAgents object is no longer dead, because it is tied to the new
instance of the dispatcher.

    >>> poll = zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher)
    >>> def wait_for_pending(job):
    ...     for i in range(60):
    ...         t = transaction.begin()
    ...         if job.status in (zc.async.interfaces.PENDING):
    ...             break
    ...         time_sleep(0.1)
    ...     else:
    ...         assert False, 'job never pending'
    >>> wait_for_pending(job)
    >>> job in da['main']
    False
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True
    >>> da.dead
    False
    >>> queue[0] is job
    True

Now we need to wait for the job.

    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(job)
    42
    >>> callback_job.status == zc.async.interfaces.COMPLETED
    True
    >>> callback_job.result
    'I got result 42'
    >>> policy = job.getRetryPolicy()
    >>> policy.data.get('interruptions')
    1

The dispatcher cleaned up its own "hard" crash.

Hard Crash During Job with Sibling Recovery
-------------------------------------------

Our next catastrophe is the same as the one before, except, after one
dispatcher's hard crash, another dispatcher is around to clean up the dead
jobs.

To show this, we will start a job, start a second dispatcher, simulate the
first dispatcher dying "hard," and watch the second dispatcher clean up
after the first one.

So, first we start a long-running job in the dispatcher as before.

    >>> lock.acquire()
    True
    >>> fail_flag = True
    >>> job = queue.put(wait_for_me)
    >>> callback_job = job.addCallback(handle_result)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get()
    >>> poll = zc.async.testing.get_poll(dispatcher)
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_start(job, seconds=30) # XXX not sure why so long

Now we'll start up an alternate dispatcher.

    >>> import uuid
    >>> alt_uuid = uuid.uuid1()
    >>> zc.async.subscribers.ThreadedDispatcherInstaller(
    ...     poll_interval=0.5, uuid=alt_uuid)(
    ...     zc.async.interfaces.DatabaseOpened(db))
    >>> alt_dispatcher = zc.async.dispatcher.get(alt_uuid)

We're also going to set the main dispatcher's ``ping_death_interval`` back to
60 seconds so we can see some polls in the alternate dispatcher before it gets
around to cleaning up.

    >>> da.ping_death_interval = datetime.timedelta(seconds=60)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> 

Now we'll "crash" the dispatcher.

    >>> dispatcher.activated = False # this will make polling stop, without
    ...                              # cleanup
    >>> dispatcher.reactor.callFromThread(dispatcher.reactor.crash)
    >>> dispatcher.thread.join(3)
    >>> dispatcher.thread.isAlive()
    False

As discussed in the previous example, the polling hasn't timed out yet, so the
alternate dispatcher can't know that the first one is dead. Therefore, the job
is still sitting around in the old dispatcher's pile in the database.

    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True
    >>> da.dead
    False
    >>> job.status == zc.async.interfaces.ACTIVE
    True
    >>> alt_poll_1 = zc.async.testing.get_poll(alt_dispatcher)
    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> job in da['main']
    True
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True
    >>> da.dead
    False
    >>> alt_poll_2 = zc.async.testing.get_poll(alt_dispatcher)
    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> job in da['main']
    True
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True
    >>> da.dead
    False

Above, the ping_death_interval was returned to the default of 60 seconds. To
speed up the realization of our second dispatcher that the first one is dead,
we'll set the ping_death_interval back down to just one second.

    >>> da.ping_death_interval
    datetime.timedelta(0, 60)
    >>> import datetime
    >>> da.ping_death_interval = datetime.timedelta(seconds=1)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_death(da)
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True

After the second dispatcher gets a poll--a chance to notice--it will have
cleaned up the first dispatcher's old tasks in the same way we saw in the
previous example.  The job's ``handleInterrupt`` method will be called, which
in this case will put it back in the queue to be claimed and performed.

    >>> alt_poll_3 = zc.async.testing.get_poll(alt_dispatcher)
    >>> _ = transaction.begin()
    >>> job in da['main']
    False
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    False
    >>> da.dead
    True
    >>> wait_for_pending(job)
    >>> queue[0] is job
    True

Now we need to wait for the job.

    >>> zc.async.testing.wait_for_result(job)
    42
    >>> callback_job.status == zc.async.interfaces.COMPLETED
    True
    >>> callback_job.result
    'I got result 42'

The sibling, then, was able to clean up the mess left by the "hard" crash of
the first dispatcher.

Other Job-Related Errors
------------------------

Other problems--errors when performing or committing jobs--are handled within
jobs, getting the decisions from retry policies as described above.  These
are demonstrated in the job.txt document.
