Agents choose and keep track of jobs for a dispatcher.  It is a
component in the zc.async design that is intended to be pluggable.

Arguably the most interesting method to control is ``claimJob``.  It is 
responsible for getting the next job from the queue.

The default implementation in zc.async.agent allows you to pass in a callable
that, given the agent, claims and returns the desired job.  The default
callable simply asks for the next job.

Let's take a quick look at how the agent works.  Let's imagine we have a
queue with a dispatcher with an agent [#setUp]_.

The agent is initially empty.

    >>> len(agent)
    0
    >>> bool(agent)
    False
    >>> list(agent)
    []

Dispatchers ask the agent to claim jobs.  Initially there are no jobs to
claim.

    >>> print agent.claimJob()
    None
    >>> list(agent)
    []

We can add some jobs to claim.

    >>> def mock_work():
    ...     return 42
    ...
    >>> job1 = queue.put(mock_work)
    >>> job2 = queue.put(mock_work)
    >>> job3 = queue.put(mock_work)
    >>> job4 = queue.put(mock_work)
    >>> job5 = queue.put(mock_work)

It will only claim as many active jobs as its size.

    >>> agent.size
    3
    >>> job1 is agent.claimJob()
    True
    >>> job2 is agent.claimJob()
    True
    >>> job3 is agent.claimJob()
    True
    >>> print agent.claimJob()
    None
    >>> len(agent)
    3
    >>> list(agent) == [job1, job2, job3]
    True
    >>> job1.parent is agent
    True
    >>> job2.parent is agent
    True
    >>> job3.parent is agent
    True

When a job informs its agent that it is done, the agent moves the job to
the ``completed`` collection [#test_completed]_.

    >>> len(agent.completed)
    0
    >>> job2()
    42
    >>> list(agent) == [job1, job3]
    True
    >>> len(agent)
    2
    >>> len(agent.completed)
    1
    >>> list(agent.completed) == [job2]
    True
    >>> job2.parent is agent
    True

The completed collection rotates, by default, to get old jobs rotated out in
about a week.

Now we can claim another job.

    >>> job4 is agent.claimJob()
    True
    >>> print agent.claimJob()
    None
    >>> list(agent) == [job1, job3, job4]
    True
    >>> len(agent)
    3

An agent may not claim a job if its parent is considered deactivated or dead.
This is a safeguard for unlikely situations in which a parent dispatcher has
been incorrectly labeled as dead because of ping times (see catastrophes.txt
for details).

    >>> da.deactivate()
    >>> len(agent)
    0
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    False
    >>> print agent.claimJob()
    None
    >>> da.activate()
    >>> import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> da.activated = da.last_ping.value = (datetime.datetime.now(pytz.UTC) -
    ...                                      datetime.timedelta(days=365))
    >>> bool(da.activated)
    True
    >>> da.dead
    True
    >>> print agent.claimJob()
    None
    >>> da.deactivate()
    >>> da.activate()
    >>> agent.claimJob() is job5
    True
    >>> len(agent)
    1

This particular agent invites you to provide a function to choose jobs.
The default one simply chooses the first available job in the queue.

.. [#setUp] First we'll get a database and the necessary registrations.

    >>> from ZODB.tests.util import DB
    >>> db = DB()
    >>> conn = db.open()
    >>> root = conn.root()
    >>> import zc.async.configure
    >>> zc.async.configure.base()

    Now we need a queue.

    >>> import zc.async.queue
    >>> import zc.async.interfaces
    >>> container = root[zc.async.interfaces.KEY] = zc.async.queue.Queues()
    >>> queue = container[''] = zc.async.queue.Queue()
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

    Now we need an activated dispatcher agents collection.
    
    >>> import zc.async.instanceuuid
    >>> queue.dispatchers.register(zc.async.instanceuuid.UUID)
    >>> da = queue.dispatchers[zc.async.instanceuuid.UUID]
    >>> da.activate()

    And now we need an agent.
    
    >>> import zc.async.agent
    >>> agent = da['main'] = zc.async.agent.Agent()
    >>> agent.name
    'main'
    >>> agent.parent is da
    True

.. [#test_completed]

    >>> import zope.interface.verify
    >>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(
    ...     zc.async.interfaces.ICompletedCollection,
    ...     agent.completed)
    True
